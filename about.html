          <p> <h3>We get it.</h3> Being a college student means textbooks cost more than your outfit, your de facto diet is ramen noodles, and you are constantly hunting for free swag giveaways. </p>

            <p>That’s where we — players who have sacked the casinos from Reno to Santa Barbara, and made a killing playing poker against people online from all over the world  — come in. </p>

           <p> Poker at Berkeley invites all members of the community, of any skill level, to learn a game that is quick to pick-up yet monumental to master; a game of skill and luck, of deception and mathematics. Above all, poker is some awesome fun, and we believe that anyone can benefit from learning to play. </p>

           <p> Poker at Berkeley ultimately strives to educate, enable, and engage Berkeley with the various games of poker, with an emphasis on Texas Hold’em. We will analyze the game from an empirical and theoretical perspective, and explore its many different applications — probability, combinatorics, statistics, psychoanalysis, player-types, professional poker, and the game’s relations to theory, computer science, financial markets, and more. </p>

           <p style="text-align:center; font-weight:600">  By the end, you should be ready to pay off those student loans in no-time.</p>

            <h4> Co-president </h4>
            <p>Jameson is a freshman majoring in EECS from Ventura, California. His poker roots hail from his high school grad night, where he learned the entire game the night before a school-sponsored charity tournament (he lost in the first 10 minutes). Despite this, he continued studying poker, finding there was always room for improvement and reflection. He began forging his poker name at the humble Chumash Casino, located on Indian Reserve territory in the back mountains of Santa Barbara — that is, before they raised the minimum-age to 21. Jameson’s other interests include stock and options trading, flying UAV’s, triathlons, golf, rowing, piano, and painting. Contact Jameson at: jamesonmah@berkeley.edu </p>
